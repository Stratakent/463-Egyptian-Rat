How to Play (4 players)

Players are dealt an equal amount of cards face down. Play rotates clockwise where each player places the top card of their deck onto the play area. If two cards of the same value are played sequentially, players have the oppurtunity to slap the pile, first player to do so, gets the pile and adds the cards to their current deck. If the card played is a face (jack,queen king) or an ace, the next player has a to play a certain amount of cards on their turn. If that player fails to play either another face card or a double, the first player gains the entire pile. Play continues until one player holds the entire deck.
